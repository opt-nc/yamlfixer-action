# ‚ùî About

This github-action is based on the tool [`Yamlfixer`](https://github.com/opt-nc/yamlfixer) : 

- Developed by [`@tamere-allo-peter`](https://github.com/tamere-allo-peter)
- Integrated as a Github Action by [`@mbarre`](https://github.com/mbarre)

It **automatically fixes** some errors and warnings reported by `yamllint` and creates **a pull request that embeds the fixes**.

## üß∞ Usage

See [action.yml](action.yml)

You need a Github account that is allowed to create pull request on the inspected repository.

Find below an example that allows to check `yaml` files **on each push** with verbose mode :

```yaml
name: Lint yaml files

on: [push]

jobs:
  lint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout my app
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Lint yaml files
        uses: opt-nc/yamlfixer-action
        with:
            options: --summary
            user: ${{secrets.my_user}}
            token: ${{secrets.my_user_password}}
```

The github-action creates :

1. A new branch named `yamlfixer/patch/$branch_name`
2. The pull request to be merged into the working branch
